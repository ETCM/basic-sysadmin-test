Compliance Questions
====================
Answer the following immediately following the question.

Q1) Describe your experience working with regulatory compliance issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Restrict your answers to compliance issues such as:

- [STIGs](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/)
- [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php)
- [SOX](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-107hr3763enr/html/BILLS-107hr3763enr.htm)


This list is suggestive, not restrictive. Include details pertaining to system
configuration, auditing and verification.


Q2) Broadly describe how you would investigate the following scenario:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You have a public facing site running PHP 5.4.12, Apache 2.2.24, MySQL 5.5.30
and vBulletin 4.2.0. The provisioning record does not mention what kernel is
installed, but the machine is a Linux host. The site runs custom software
providing an eletronic store for a niche good and hosts an enthusiast
discussion community.

The forum moderators report the existence of a post mocking the site
administrators for an inability to secure data. A fragment of the owner's
private profile information is in the post.

Bullet points will suffice for this.

Q3) Describe how distributions like RHEL complicate compliance issues.
