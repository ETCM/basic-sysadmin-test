Scripting and Automation
========================

Q1) Bash-Fu, Python Prowess, Perl Perfection, Ruby Revelation...
----------------------------------------------------------------
Drop a script in this directory which does something amazing.

Q2) Explain
-----------
What are the interesting parts of your script? What do they do?

Q3) Automated Provisioning
--------------------------
Puppet, Chef, Salt, Fabric, vCenter. What are they? Tell me why I should care
about them. Describe your experiences with some or all of them.

- Puppet

  A tool that is used for configration management of Linux and Windows based systems. It also provides the ability to
  perform patch management, provisioning, reporting and task automation. 

  You should care about this tool because it offers a robust feature set that can allow for the management of many
  systems within an enterprise environment. It is also a very good way to improve the efficiency among your system
  administrators and can greatly reduce the setup time for new server configuration.

- Chef
  
  A framework for automating infrastructure. Like puppet this framwork allows for the deployment of servers and  
  applications. It allows for the centralization of configurations. This framework is designed to be able to work with 
  cloud hosted services as well as both physical and virtual systems.

  You should care about this tool because it allows for centralized configurations that can be pulled directly from the 
  main server. This reduces the need for multiple people to configured every system within an environment. An admin only
  needs to create a configuration for a particular situation and let the tool do the rest of the work. It relieves you
  from the burdens of committing a large number of resources to system deployment.
  
- Salt
  
  Configuration and management tool used for infrastructure that boasts flexibility. It is supposed to be flexible for a 
  wide range of applications and easily modifiable for use by different system administrators. This is achieved by the 
  different modules that manage different actions.

  You should use this if you need the ability to be flexible or would like to distribute the workload among different 
  administrators. 
  
- Fabric
  
  A configuration management library that uses SSH to deploy applications and perform system administration task. The 
  library allows configurations to be pushed out to clients. 

  This tool can be used to integrate with tools such as Puppet and Chef. It is also a an open source tool so it can be 
  modified to fit different environments and needs.

- vCenter

  An application that allows for management of ESXi hosts and virtual machines. This tool allows an administrator to 
  have centralized control over a virtual infrastructure through a suite of management tools. It can also be used to 
  automate many tasks for many servers at one time.
  
  This tool can increase an administrators productivity within a virtualized environment. Hundreds of servers can be 
  efficiently managed by using vCenter. The tool also presents a great amount of detail about the metrics and vitals of 
  the system within a robust GUI. This allows the administrator to make more informed decisions based off this intuitive
  reporting.
  
I have had no experience with any of these tools.
