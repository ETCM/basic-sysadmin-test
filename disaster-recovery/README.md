Disaster Recovery Design and Verification
=========================================
Answer the following questions immediately below each question.

Q1) Disaster Recovery and Continuous Operations
-----------------------------------------------
What is the relationship between DR and COOP? What are the driving factors
pertaining to this type of planning?

Q2) Disaster Recovery Planning
------------------------------
How do DNS, layer-4 switches and layer-7 logic relate to DR situations? What
is a transparent failure?

Q3) Disaster Recovery Practice
------------------------------
How does production deployment relate to DR? Describe the concerns with
reverting a production deployment.

Q4) DR Scenario
---------------
You have a production site with a partial service-capacity, replicated back-up
site. The primary and back-up sites are connected with a direct fiber backplane
for fail-over and consistency communication. Someone hits the fiber with a
backhoe. Is this an issue? If it is, how would you design the total system to
mitigate any problems?
