=====================

Q1) A service is repeatedly crashing. How do you identify possible causes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2) Scenario:
-------------
Given a collection of internal assets which are partitioned into several classes where each class runs a distinct set of services. Network structure is such that two nodes of different classes may not be able to directly communicate. One class of nodes is for data aggregation and another integrates to an external enterprise peer. There is a message bus for passing work between classes.

Describe in bullet points how you would monitor such a system. Include a set of health metrics and targets.

Q3) In Linux, how do you identify what resources a given process has?
