External Connectivity
=====================
Our production assets require high-availability to external resources as the
information gathered is time-sensitive and missed results may not be
recoverable.

Q1) Heart-beat Check
====================
Include in this directory a script which verifies that a given IP address is
not blacklisted from any public IRC service.

Q2) Feedback
============
Describe how you would ensure timely feedback in the event that an asset in
production is blacklisted.

Q3) Enterprise Integration
==========================
How would you ensure connectivity between an order-processing asset and an
external credit card processing system? If you have never worked with such
a system, describe another enterprise integration issue from your experience.
