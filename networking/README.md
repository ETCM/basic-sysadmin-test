Networking Architecture, Design and Maintainence
================================================

Please answer the following questions.

Q1) What are the OSI layers and how do they relate day-to-day operations?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2) Cisco/Juniper/Equivalent: Pick one and explain how to configure a VLAN.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3) What is the difference between an application switch and a layer-2/3 switch?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4) How does virtualization interact with network design?
---------------------------------------------------------

Q5) TCP Handshake. What is it?
------------------------------

Q6) What is the difference between a MAC address and an IP address?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A MAC address is a hardware identifier that is primarily used for layer-2 network addressing. An IP address is a logical layer-3 address that is used for routing traffic both within and outside of the originating network. Since MAC addressing is a layer 2 protocol it can not be used to route traffic to the internet or other networks. IP addressing has this ability and is not tied to the hardware in the same way as a MAC address.

Q7) ARP Storm vs ARP Poisoning. Compare and Contrast.
-----------------------------------------------------

Q8) Scenario Response:
----------------------
Your organization's network administrator contacts you, noting that a host using IP 192.168.100.106 is flooding the network.  You decide to take that host offline in the short term to prevent additional flooding.  Your network uses Cisco switches.  How would you identify which port to shut down?
