DevOps Support
==============

This position will require a significant amount of collaboration with developers
and testers. You will be expected to support the development process.
Experience with ITIL or Continuous Delivery environments is preferred.

Question
========

Please explain the extent of your experience in DevOps environments. Include
information about specific software development methodologies you have
supported and your specific role in these environments. 

The role I played within DevOps environments was to provide user feedback to the developers so that we could come to an understanding of what the user needed to be implemented and what the developer was trying to create. This would include verbal translations of what I believe the end user would like to see implemented to the developers.

Within these environments there was no defined development methodology that I could see or recognize. My experience has been working with a single developer who liased with contracted teams in different countries.
